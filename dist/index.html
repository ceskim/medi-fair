Lower-income, underprivileged, and often minority individuals struggle to get the healthcare they need or adequate insurance coverage. Furthermore, socioeconomic status can significantly impact health outcomes, patient satisfaction, and physician perception of the care and treatment a patient needs. <br><br> Without adequate care or service, low-income families have a higher death rate from a variety of conditions as well as lower life expectancy. Equally important, persons with low incomes seek health care less often, and when they do seek healthcare, it is more likely to be for an emergency. This issue has potentially deadly consequences for several reasons. Income heavily impacts the overall health of a person, the ability to get insurance, and the lack of resources in community care centers.</p>

Some people are born with a disabling condition (e.g., Down syndrome) or demonstrate a mental/physical disability early in life (e.g., autism, bipolar disorder). Others acquire disabilities through injury (e.g., spinal cord injury) or a chronic condition (e.g., limb loss because of diabetes), and still others develop a disability in later stages of life (e.g., dementia, age-related mobility disability). The health needs of people with disabilities vary with the type of limitation (e.g., mobility or cognitive) and through the condition underlying the disability (e.g., spina bifida, Down syndrome).<br> <br>For some, such as people who acquire a disability through injury, the nature of their disability can be differentiated more readily from their health status. For others, their health status and other external factors may even lead to or directly cause their disability (e.g., diabetes leading to limb loss and vision loss). Race/ethnicity, age, language, sex or gender, poverty, and low education can compound the impact of disability, leading to even poorer health and quality of life. People with disabilities are a diverse group who share the experience of living with significant limitations in functioning and, as a result, often experience exclusion from full participation in their communities.</p>

Educational discrepancies are one of them. People who have access to quality education throughout their lives tend to stay healthier than people who don’t. Education gives individuals a more promising chance at upward mobility, which also places them in better financial circumstances to access quality health care—keeping them better informed about how to take care of their health. <br><br>

                    For example, an individual with a college degree may have better skills to evaluate conflicting or complex information they read on the internet about how to care for their pre-diabetes. In addition, someone with less formal education may be less prepared to decide between reliable and unreliable information. Furthermore, less education is linked to lower income, which tends to be focused on poorer health. Numerous studies show that people in lower socioeconomic situations experience more obesity, asthma, diabetes, heart disease, and other health problems than people in better financial circumstances.</p>

Gender inequality can influence a person’s experiences of crises and emergencies, their exposure to diseases, and their access to healthcare, water, hygiene, and sanitation. <br><br> Gender inequality disproportionately affects women and girls. In most societies, they have lower status with less control over decision-making about their bodies, in their intimate relationships, families, and communities, exposing them to violence, coercion, and harmful practices. <br><br>Women and girls face high risks of unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections, including but not limited to HIV, cervical cancer, malnutrition, and depression, amongst others. Gender inequality also poses barriers for women and girls to access health information and critical services, including restrictions on mobility, lack of decision-making autonomy, limited access to finances, lower literacy rates, and discriminatory attitudes toward healthcare providers.</p>

A growing body of research shows that centuries of racism in this country had a profound, negative impact on communities of color. This impact is pervasive and deeply embedded in our society—affecting where one lives, learns, works, worships, and plays and creating inequities in access to a spectrum of social and economic benefits—such as housing, education, wealth, and employment. <br><br> These conditions—often referred to as social determinants of health—are key drivers of health inequities within communities of color, placing those within these populations at greater risk for poor health outcomes. <br><br> Data shows that racial and ethnic minority groups throughout the United States experience higher rates of illness and death across a wide range of health conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, obesity, asthma, and heart disease, compared to their White counterparts. Additionally, the life expectancy of non-Hispanic/Black Americans is four years lower than that of White Americans. The COVID-19 pandemic and its disproportionate impact among racial and ethnic minority populations is another stark example of these enduring health disparities.</p>
