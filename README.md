Unfortunately, we couldn't fully figure out how to host the website, but here's the Figma design link to ensure you can check out the contents more carefully. Here's the <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/w7a2GyRWJ71LgUyupmEgtx/Website-%26-Components?node-id=339%3A3418&t=aCAtmtX9ZlewA1JW-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">design</a>.

Along with that, here's the <a href="https://cloud.protopie.io/p/917510fdac2bd5dfa9d79d51" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a> to the interactive design, make sure to click around, there's a LOT of fun stuff we put in! For humor, and to make it as user-friendly/functional as possible. Even if we couldn't finish all the features, we made sure to add in some cool disclaimers along with some resources we compiled.

All other resources/research are linked on the submission project, and on our interactive/functional prototypes/Figma.
